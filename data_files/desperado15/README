Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to
a port on localhost in the range 15000 to 15999. First find out which of these ports are listening.
There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you
whatever you send to it.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, nc, nmap
